Welcome to an all new AMORC Austral-asia.

It's been a key moment of renewal in Austral-asia and we're excited to finally release the first phase of our new look and focus.

We've started with a new website and there's plenty more to come, including a new online store and member platform.

The paint is not even dry on most of this new website.

If you see anything that looks a little empty, it's ok we're working and will get to it soon.

With such a huge upgrade, we're taking things step-by-step, but we wanted to get out there what we've already created.

Once we've ironed out any bugs we find during the soft launch, we'll shift to opening the new members site. It'll be ready as soon as we can.

For current members, fees continue to be processed through the existing bookshop, upgrades to our fee payment systï»¿em as well as our online store are coming soon.

Thank you for your support and understanding.

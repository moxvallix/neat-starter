*The Rosicrucian Order* also known as the *Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis* (AMORC) is an inclusive, worldwide, philosophical community; exploring spiritual wisdom and contributing to the evolution of consciousness.

We recognise the sacred that dwells in each individual and the mystical dimension of all life. We welcome new members regardless of gender, race, religion or social advantage.

Our members are asked to question the laws of the universe for themselves. We do not need gurus, dogma or absolutism, but instead encourage an inner desire to discover the mysteries of life.

Collectively as a mystical fraternity we seek to perpetuate Rosicrucian tradition as was historically revealed by the College of the Rose-Croix in 1614.

The teachings trace to the Mystery Schools of the ancient world and pertain to the mysteries of the universe, nature and humanity.
